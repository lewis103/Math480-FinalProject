Math480-FinalProject
====================

For my Final Project I created a LaTeX document exploring and proving the golden ratio. I used SAGE to help prove and show certain aspects of it. You can see the Latex Code File for my code and I emailed the final PDF directly to you. However it can also be viewed here.  (I don't think it looks as good as the original PDF document) http://www.viewdocsonline.com/document/q4z773 click "export as PDF" to view the PDF file.
